          <p>Teacher + Student = dumb and dumber</p>

            We had no idea there were so many dumb IT trainers and students out
            there.

            Neil Meyers, library assistant from Gilles Plains in SA, recalls an
            incident with a part-time computer lecturer a couple of years ago.
          </p>

          <p>
            "I work in a vocational education library, and, on night shift,
            library staff are the default computer technicians/troubleshooters.
            One night, this part-time lecturer came to the counter, stating that
            she'd managed to get a CD-ROM disc stuck in the drive. She also said
            she felt a bit foolish, because she was instructing a class in basic
            computing and was unable to solve the problem in front of a room
            full of students.

            David Tune of Boambee, NSW, was reminded of a particularly clever
            pair of IT Diploma students who handed in a joint research
            assignment, complete with the required signed statement that it was
            all their original work.
          </p>

          <p>
            Tune recalls: "Upon reading the work for grading, I was incredibly
            impressed to find three pages of the document written in perfect
            technical German, particularly given that the students in question
            were none too articulate when I asked 'Sprechen sie Deutsch?'
          </p>

          <p>
            End result: assignment rejected, students counselled and more care
            taken when cutting and pasting to cover assignment work.
          </p>

            So I wandered over to give her assistance, pushed the drive eject
            button, out popped the tray and... no disc to be seen.
          </p>

          <p>
            Before I was able to ask out the obvious question, she piped up,
            'That's the CD drive? I thought it was the other one!', pointing to
            an old 5.25in floppy disc slot, which was there even though the
            drives themselves had long since been decommissioned.

            "I was told to set up a projector in one of the meeting rooms for
            school staff, as there was a presentation. Having done that, I
            hooked the presentation laptop to the network and tried to help one
            of the speakers from the IT faculty update the laptop to IE7. I
            logged off and asked her to log on with her account to try IE7.
          </p>

          <p>
            What is that?' she asked when the IE7 install process asked whether
            phishing should be turned on. After I explained it, she told me that
            she was about to present a talk on internet security."

            Someone from IT got out the disc the next day when they upended the
            machine and it fell out. Then, a week later, after I gave the
            lecturer her CD back, she was back within five minutes, saying, 'You
            won't believe it, I've done it again!'

          <p>DOESN'T IT JUST WORK?

Ian Caldewell, a self-styled 'PC tinkerer', refurbishes PCs, and has ways of
acquiring modems, monitors, CPUs, boxes and RAM - to the point where it has
become a pastime consuming most of his leisure time. He now has streams of
people seeking repairs, advice and assistance.

"Recently, I replaced an old power supply for a couple, and, when they came
to collect, they asked whether I made house calls.

I said I could and asked what they needed."

The lady told Caldewell she'd bought a new wireless mouse, and, since it
was the last one on display, it didn't come with a box or instructions.

"I asked her: 'Did you put batteries in it?!'

She hadn't, of course."</p>

          <p>MAKE MY DAY, PC

Chris Aitken, a designer and programmer from Camden, NSW, believes his story
proves that tech support is one of the most stressful jobs on earth. He recalls
working for a small internet provider in the late '90s, when one of the customers
was a local police officer.

"He was also an expert in crashing Windows 98. On one occasion, he brought his
tower into the office, sat it on the counter, pulled his service pistol out of
his holster and pointed it straight at the tower, threatening to shoot it.

Another time he put his (by now very nervous) PC tower onto the counter, again
took out his pistol, held it by the barrel and started banging the butt of the
gun onto the top of the computer, quite hard too.

It's no wonder techies go grey - or bald - early!"

This is the first we've heard of someone trying to fix a computer by intimidating it.</p>
